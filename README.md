<h1 align="center">Stitch 'N Bitch</h1>
<h2 align="center">A Home for Crafters</h2>

Crafters can find and build groups that meet regularly to quilt, knit, crochet, needlepoint, sew, and do other handicrafts while tracking their own and othersâ€™ progress on current and past projects. With Stitch 'N Bitch it's never been easier to build community around the activities you love.

## Inspiration

Historically, women have used these gatherings as a way to gather and build community. During the 80s and 90s women in the Feminist, Punk, and DIY circles brought these craft circles back to life, using them as a place to reclaim women's work and build political movements. Ever since, the Stitch 'N Bitch has remained alive and well but there has never been a platform dedicated entirely to them.
